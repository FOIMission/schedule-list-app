# schedule-list-app
Personalized floating schedule list is created by AI-technology
Maybe I use it personally, but sharing is a happy thing for others including me.
The another thing is that I commit my first application when I creat this account several minutes ago. I think I should continue producting. Sounds like good!
I creat this app by using python. Sometimes I also write some django, perhaps I  will commit more django projects in the future.
My study is not just like this. I write some verilog code in FPGA tools. Some mcu designed logic I think I have. HAHA, it's toooooo much!
So, hope that I can be perserverance.
THANKS!
